// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out
// which one of the given numbers differs from the others. 
//Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. 
//Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the 
//given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test,
// which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)


// Example 

// iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

// iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd

let arr =[2,4,7,8,10]


function iqTest(n){
     let odd = (n=>n % 2 == 0)
    if(n)
}

console.log(iqTest(arr));

function iqTest(numbers){
    // ...
    let a=[];
    let e =[];
    let o =[]
    a=numbers.split(" ");
    for(let i=0;i<a.length;i++)
    {
    if(a[i]%2==0){ e.push(i)}
    else
    o.push(i);
    }
    if(e.length>1)
    return o[0]+1;
    
    return e[0]+1;
  }
